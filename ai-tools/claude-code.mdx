## Navigating Flight Grid

Daysheets has re imagined manual flight grids, making it quick and easy to manage hundreds of flights across your tour. Once you've added flights, they will appear in the flight grid. 

To access the flight grid, click on flight grid on the left menu. Your flights will appear in the grid, and sort based on departure date and time by default. 

Columns can be resized, re ordered, or hidden, and flights can be filtered in various ways. Filters and Search make it simple to find a singular flight, or export a specific set of flights to export.

Filter and Search 

By default the flight grid hides flights in the past. By using the dropdown next to the search, you can toggle between 

## Setup

1. Install Claude Code globally:

```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

2. Navigate to your docs directory.
3. (Optional) Add the `CLAUDE.md` file below to your project.
4. Run `claude` to start.

## Create `CLAUDE.md`

Create a `CLAUDE.md` file at the root of your documentation repository to train Claude Code on your specific documentation standards:

```markdown
# Mintlify documentation

## Working relationship
- You can push back on ideas-this can lead to better documentation. Cite sources and explain your reasoning when you do so
- ALWAYS ask for clarification rather than making assumptions
- NEVER lie, guess, or make up information

## Project context
- Format: MDX files with YAML frontmatter
- Config: docs.json for navigation, theme, settings
- Components: Mintlify components

## Content strategy
- Document just enough for user success - not too much, not too little
- Prioritize accuracy and usability of information
- Make content evergreen when possible
- Search for existing information before adding new content. Avoid duplication unless it is done for a strategic reason
- Check existing patterns for consistency
- Start by making the smallest reasonable changes

## Frontmatter requirements for pages
- title: Clear, descriptive page title
- description: Concise summary for SEO/navigation

## Writing standards
- Second-person voice ("you")
- Prerequisites at start of procedural content
- Test all code examples before publishing
- Match style and formatting of existing pages
- Include both basic and advanced use cases
- Language tags on all code blocks
- Alt text on all images
- Relative paths for internal links

## Git workflow
- NEVER use --no-verify when committing
- Ask how to handle uncommitted changes before starting
- Create a new branch when no clear branch exists for changes
- Commit frequently throughout development
- NEVER skip or disable pre-commit hooks

## Do not
- Skip frontmatter on any MDX file
- Use absolute URLs for internal links
- Include untested code examples
- Make assumptions - always ask for clarification
