## Navigating Flight Grid

To access the flight grid, click on flight grid on the left menu. Your flights will appear in the grid, and sort based on departure date and time by default. 

Columns can be resized, re ordered, or hidden, and flights can be filtered in various ways. Filters and Search make it simple to find a singular flight, or export a specific set of flights to export.

The search box allows you to search by the following options:

 Search results will appear in the grid, making it simple to find a single flight.  To clear the search filter, simply press the x in the seach box.

The three default views include:

- **Upcoming: **displays all flights in the future that haven't taken off.
- **In Flight: **displays all flights that are expected to be in the air.  Flight tracking coming soon\!
- **All Flights: **displays all flights that have taken place, flights in the air, and upcming flights.

The view button to the right of the default views allows you to adjust the columns, to customize your flight grid.  You can toggle on specific columns such as Final Arrival details to export an arrivals transfer grid, or toggle on flight details to see flight numbers for each flight on a passenger's trip. 

### Advanced Filters

By clicking the filter button in the top right, you can apply multiple filters to narrow down to a select set of flights. Once you click on the filter button you will see various filters you can apply.

To adjust a filter, simply tap on any of the compents.  In the screenshot above, you can change the departure airport filter from LAX to any other airport that's on the grid.  In the Departure Date filter, you can adjust "After" to be "Before" or "is" and modify the date by clicking the calendar icon. 

To remove a filter, simply press the X on the filter.  

 For example, if you select the departure airport, you can filter the flight grid to only display flights departing from Philadelphia. You can also apply a departure date filter to narrow down to flights departing from Philadelphia on a specific date.
